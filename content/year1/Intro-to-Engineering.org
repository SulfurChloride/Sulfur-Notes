5. *Source:* Does the page site other print or electronic resources?
** WAIT Where to locate Information
*** Databases:
Qualitry databases
1. Compendex (Engineering)
2. Web of Science (Science)
3. SciFinder (Chemistry)
4. Inspec (Physics, Computer Science)
*** Print Reference Sources
Printed are Sources are generally more authoritive and controlled.
*** Web source
+ The best why to locate Qualitry Information
**** Example sites from professional Engineering organizations
+ Institue of Electrical and electronics Engineers https://ieee.org
+ American Society of Mechanical Engineers https://asme.org
+ American Society of Civil Engineers https://asce.org
+ American Institue of Chemical Engineers https://aiche.org
*** Engineers as a writer
Likekly  write:
+ *Memoranda:*
  for Internal correspondence in companies. Short, deals with one subjes
+ *E-mails:*
  Most Engineers communicate primarly with Email.
+ *Technical reports:* 
  communicate work result
+ *Letters:* 
+ *journal articles:* 
+ *specifications:* 
**** Writing is POWER (cringe)
+ P: Plane
+ O: Organize
+ W: Write
+ E: Edit
